# SoftwareTesting-CateringWebsite
Catering website with front-end and back-end testing: fully automated Selenium tests, JUnit unit testing, JaCoCo code coverage testing, and PIT mutation testing. We acheived full code coverage and mutation coverage minus the allowed exceptions. Source code in CSE6329-master folder.

We used Eclipse IDE for Java and MySQL for the database.
